# ðŸš€ DevCollab â€“ Connect. Collaborate. Code.

DevCollab is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The platform allows developers to discover and connect with like-minded coders based on their tech stack, interests, experience level, and availability. Think of it as "Tinder for developers", where users swipe to find potential coding partners for collaboration, hackathons, open-source projects, or study groups.
